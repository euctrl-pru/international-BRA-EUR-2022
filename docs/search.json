    "text": "Brig. Eduardo Miguel Soares\nHead of SDOP/DECEA\nEven though the scars of the greatest crisis of the aviation system are not fully healed yet, it is already time to assess its impact on the ATM systems, understand how the regions dealt with the challenges and learn from mistakes and successes. Therefore, the partnership with EUROCONTROL became even more valuable for DECEA during the difficult period of the pandemic and post-pandemic. The historic drop in traffic volume has significantly impacted the investment capacity of air navigation service providers making the scrutiny of resource allocation an even more complex and error-intolerant activity.\n\nMoreover, the European institution’s culture of structuring strategic planning supported by robust indicators and performance frameworks inspires us to maintain the path of clear goals and well-defined indicators for attention to strategic objectives. The SIRIUS Program’s projects are examples of planning already based on performance management and further strengthened after our agencies’ partnership. For instance, in the 2021 SIRIUS Program report 1, it is possible to verify that projects management, as such the TMA SP NEO, were carried out within the performance based approach and with some of their outputs expressed in metrics directly related to the well establish indicators in Europe.\nThis standardization of performance management also facilitates communication with the entire aviation community, contributing to the necessary transparency of today, in addition to strengthening our partnership with EUROCONTROL, our most significant source of inspiration in the area of performance.\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nAir transportation contributes a significant percentage to the global economy and is a key sector in Brazil and Europe. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the sector is set for growth in the long term. Within this context, air navigation plays a major enabler role. On one side, air navigation facilitates economic recovery by responding to varying demand by airspace users, with re-emerging or new network connections. On the other side, there is an increased focus on reducing the impact of aviation on the climate, through a continual reduction of environmental impacts due to operational constraints as an immediate measure. Other measures, like market-based mechanism, global uptake of sustainable aviation fuel, or novel engine techniques and aircraft design will require more time.\nThe Brazilian Department of Airspace Control (DECEA) Performance Section and the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) jointly produced this second edition of the Brazil-Europe comparison. This bi-regional operational performance report uses commonly agreed metrics and definitions to compare, understand, and improve air the performance of navigation services (ANS). This report, and previous reports, are available online at https://ansperformance.eu/global/brazil/. It is also planned to augment the reporting with a supporting dashboard.\nThis second edition aims to consolidate the existing comparison process and expand its scope. This report updates the overview on both (Brazilian and European) air navigation systems; broadens the temporal scope, and adds new analyses. The report focuses on a subset of the eleven Key Performance Areas identified by the ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan (ICAO 2005, Appendix D).\nWhile the primacy of Safety is fully recognised, the scope of this report is limited to operational ANS performance due to data constraints. In particular, Predictability, Capacity, Efficiency and Environment, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n(ref:KPA Index)\n\n\n\n\nThis second report also introduces an initial approach to quantify the environmental impact of operational inefficiencies.\nThe comparison shows similarities and differences in the air navigation service provision and observed performance in both regions. Major take-aways of this report include:\n\nOverall, air navigation service provision is more fragmented in Europe with a higher number of local/national air navigation service providers and their respective control units. Integrated civil/military service provision is inherent to the organisation of DECEA and the Brazilian system, while in Europe a mix of co-location and integration exists, according to local/national arrangements.\nCOVID measures strongly impacted air transportation demand in both regions and affected almost all air navigation system parameters.\nThe difference between Brazil’s and Europe’s systems reacting to the seasons became more evident during the pandemic recovery. When not hit by another COVID-19 wave, the European region had greater variations in demand between the winter and summer seasons. The Brazilian flow recovered more gradually, showing a more continuous demand.\nPredictability in both systems degraded during and post COVID phase and is slowly recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nAirport runway system capacities in both systems are designed to meet the traffic levels. Capacities at the Brazilian airports were increased in light of a change of methodology to determine these capacities and changed procedures.\nThe European system showed a higher association between lower demand and increased efficiency considering additional taxi time, additional time in terminal airspace and flight time variability. Taxi performance in Brazil follows similar principles and operational procedures with no significant differences. The partial analysis of additional time in terminal airspace revealed that on average traffic in Brazil observed higher times during the arrival phase in 2021 suggesting a system-wide change. The level of variability of flight times reflected the overall trend.\nAn initial approach to quantifying the emission benefit pool on the basis of the observed additional taxi-times was developed. Emissions and the improvement pool - next to operational constraints and inefficiencies - are dependent on the fleet mix operated at the different airports. This includes the role of the airport within the respective system. Larger hubs with a higher share of traffic - and in particular heavy aircraft operations - showed a higher contribution to the overall emission benefit pool.\n\nThis report will be updated throughout the coming years under the umbrella of the DECEA-EUROCONTROL memorandum of cooperation. It is also planned to establish a web-based rolling monitoring updated on a regular basis. Future editions will complement the data time series and support the development of further use-case analyses. The lessons learnt of this joint project will be coordinated with the multi-national Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the ICAO GANP Study sub-group concerned with the further development of the GANP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(https://www.decea.mil.br/static/uploads/2022/04/Realizacoes-SIRIUS-2021.pdf)↩︎"
