Collaboration and harmonisation are key and intrinsic principles of the
aviation world. These principles were never as important as they are
today, as the aviation community emerges from its worst crisis ever in
the last two and half years. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, pressure on
the air transportation system tested the resilience of the most
integrated and interdependent mode of transport. When the pandemic was
finally relieved, the Russian invasion of Ukraine raised the bar against
recovery even higher, with rising fuel costs and much uncertainty once
again. More than ever, the aviation system should look to its
principles.

Without collaboration - both on regional and international level - and
the promotion and application of standards, the aviation system we know
today, would never have come to pass, and will undoubtedly fail in the
future. With that in mind, this second comparison report reflects the
efforts of Brazil and Europe to keep moving in the direction of
cooperation and standardisation in the field of operational air
navigation system performance. Furthermore, the global community is
asking for all its sectors to improve efficiency and reduce
environmental impact. Additionally to the challenges mentioned above,
addressing the carbon footprint of air transportation and how air
navigation can help in this context is mandatory. In this context
transparency plays a fundamental role. This comparison report adds to
providing a transparent basis for an informed discussion by providing
data-driven analyses to identify performance gaps and allow stakeholders
to understand better and even participate in finding solutions to the
issues on the table.

Even though the scars of the greatest crisis of the aviation system are
not fully healed yet, it is already time to assess its impact on the ATM
systems, understand how the regions dealt with the challenges and learn
from mistakes and successes. Therefore, the partnership with EUROCONTROL
became even more valuable for DECEA during the difficult period of the
pandemic and post-pandemic. The historic drop in traffic volume has
significantly impacted the investment capacity of air navigation service
providers making the scrutiny of resource allocation an even more
complex and error-intolerant activity.

Moreover, the European institution's culture of structuring strategic
planning supported by robust indicators and performance frameworks
inspires us to maintain the path of clear goals and well-defined
indicators for attention to strategic objectives. The SIRIUS Program's
projects are examples of planning already based on performance
management and further strengthened after our agencies' partnership. For
instance, in the 2021 SIRIUS Program report \footnote{(https://www.decea.mil.br/static/uploads/2022/04/Realizacoes-SIRIUS-2021.pdf)},
it is possible to verify that projects management, as such the TMA SP
NEO, were carried out within the performance based approach and with
some of their outputs expressed in metrics directly related to the well
establish indicators in Europe.

This standardization of performance management also facilitates
communication with the entire aviation community, contributing to the
necessary transparency of today, in addition to strengthening our
partnership with EUROCONTROL, our most significant source of inspiration
in the area of performance.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Executive Summary}

Air transportation contributes a significant percentage to the global
economy and is a key sector in Brazil and Europe. Despite the impact of
COVID-19, the sector is set for growth in the long term. Within this
context, air navigation plays a major enabler role. On one side, air
navigation facilitates economic recovery by responding to varying demand
by airspace users, with re-emerging or new network connections. On the
other side, there is an increased focus on reducing the impact of
aviation on the climate, through a continual reduction of environmental
impacts due to operational constraints as an immediate measure. Other
measures, like market-based mechanism, global uptake of sustainable
aviation fuel, or novel engine techniques and aircraft design will
require more time.

The Brazilian Department of Airspace Control (DECEA) Performance Section
and the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) jointly produced this
second edition of the Brazil-Europe comparison. This bi-regional
operational performance report uses commonly agreed metrics and
definitions to compare, understand, and improve air the performance of
navigation services (ANS). This report, and previous reports, are
available online at https://ansperformance.eu/global/brazil/. It is also
planned to augment the reporting with a supporting dashboard.

This second edition aims to consolidate the existing comparison process
and expand its scope. This report updates the overview on both
(Brazilian and European) air navigation systems; broadens the temporal
scope, and adds new analyses. The report focuses on a subset of the
eleven Key Performance Areas identified by the ICAO Global Air
Navigation Plan (ICAO 2005, Appendix D).

While the primacy of Safety is fully recognised, the scope of this
report is limited to operational ANS performance due to data
constraints. In particular, Predictability, Capacity, Efficiency and
Environment, as shown below.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,height=\textheight]{././figures/KPA-and-KPI.png}

}

\end{figure}

This second report also introduces an initial approach to quantify the
environmental impact of operational inefficiencies.

The comparison shows similarities and differences in the air navigation
service provision and observed performance in both regions. Major
take-aways of this report include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Overall, air navigation service provision is more fragmented in Europe
  with a higher number of local/national air navigation service
  providers and their respective control units. Integrated
  civil/military service provision is inherent to the organisation of
  DECEA and the Brazilian system, while in Europe a mix of co-location
  and integration exists, according to local/national arrangements.
\item
  COVID measures strongly impacted air transportation demand in both
  regions and affected almost all air navigation system parameters.
\item
  The difference between Brazil's and Europe's systems reacting to the
  seasons became more evident during the pandemic recovery. When not hit
  by another COVID-19 wave, the European region had greater variations
  in demand between the winter and summer seasons. The Brazilian flow
  recovered more gradually, showing a more continuous demand.
\item
  Predictability in both systems degraded during and post COVID phase
  and is slowly recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels.
\item
  Airport runway system capacities in both systems are designed to meet
  the traffic levels. Capacities at the Brazilian airports were
  increased in light of a change of methodology to determine these
  capacities and changed procedures.
\item
  The European system showed a higher association between lower demand
  and increased efficiency considering additional taxi time, additional
  time in terminal airspace and flight time variability. Taxi
  performance in Brazil follows similar principles and operational
  procedures with no significant differences. The partial analysis of
  additional time in terminal airspace revealed that on average traffic
  in Brazil observed higher times during the arrival phase in 2021
  suggesting a system-wide change. The level of variability of flight
  times reflected the overall trend.
\item
  An initial approach to quantifying the emission benefit pool on the
  basis of the observed additional taxi-times was developed. Emissions
  and the improvement pool - next to operational constraints and
  inefficiencies - are dependent on the fleet mix operated at the
  different airports. This includes the role of the airport within the
  respective system. Larger hubs with a higher share of traffic - and in
  particular heavy aircraft operations - showed a higher contribution to
  the overall emission benefit pool.
\end{itemize}

This report will be updated throughout the coming years under the
umbrella of the DECEA-EUROCONTROL memorandum of cooperation. It is also
planned to establish a web-based rolling monitoring updated on a regular
basis. Future editions will complement the data time series and support
the development of further use-case analyses. The lessons learnt of this
joint project will be coordinated with the multi-national Performance
Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the ICAO GANP Study sub-group
concerned with the further development of the GANP Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs).

\section{Background}\label{background}}

Since its first flights, the aviation world has learned that
standardisation is the key to healthy and prosperous growth. Over the
years, the good lessons experienced in sharing standards in operational
activities have spread to all areas, including organisational management
and strategic planning. In the early 2000s, ICAO proposed an approach
inspired by the renowned PDCA cycle, adding performance-based management
to it. Although ICAO emphasises the importance of a performance-based
approach, the lack of a common understanding of establishing and
calculating the indicators would make them internationally useless.
Therefore, in 2016, interested stakeholders developed a set of key
performance indicators used by a variety of organisations to establish a
common set of indicators. This set of indicators is proposed as part of
the ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan update cycle and the related
Aviation System Block Upgrades. Stakeholders are encouraged to share
their common understanding and lessons learnt from measuring air
navigation system performance and providing input to the decision making
process in terms of operational procedure changes and deployment of
novel enabling technologies.

With this willingness to partner and share, Brazil and Europe,
represented by DECEA and EUROCONTROL, signed a cooperation agreement in
2015. Amongst other activities, this agreement entails the collaboration
and joint developments in the field of operational performance
benchmarking of Air Navigation Services (ANS).

Based on this agreement, the Brazilian Department of Airspace Control
(DECEA) started a Working Group, which has become the ATM Performance
Indicators Management Committee, aiming at improving performance-based
management. Through lessons learnt from the best practices observed at
EUROCONTROL, and in particular its Performance Review Unit (PRU), DECEA
established the Performance Section.

DECEA Performance Section and the PRU have established a joint project
to foster the common understanding and harmonised interpretation of the
proposed ICAO GANP indicators. The technical work has been conducted
throughout the recent years comprising joint face-to-face
workshops/meetings and a series of web-based discussions. An essential
part of the work entailed the identification and validation of
comparable data sources, the development of a joint data preparatory
process, and supporting analyses to produce this report.

\hypertarget{scope}{%
\section{Scope}\label{scope}}

Comparisons and operational benchmarking activities require common
definitions and joint understanding. Hence the work in this report draws
from commonly accepted outputs of previous work from ICAO, other bi- or
multi-regional operational benchmarking activities (e.g.~PBWG
\footnote{The Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) is a
  multi-regional group with participation from Singapore, Thailand,
  Japan, Brazil, China, United States, and Europe.}), and regional or
organisational practices. The key performance indicators (KPIs) used in
this report are developed using procedures on best available data from
both the DECEA Performance Section and PRU. The comparison described in
this report does not address all eleven Key Performance Areas (KPA).
From an indicator perspective, DECEA Performance Section and PRU agreed
to focus on an operational benchmarking and to collaborate on the basis
of the currently proposed performance indicators coordinated by ICAO in
conjunction with the update of the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP).
This second edition builds on the initial report and focuses on system
characteristics and the KPAs Capacity, Efficiency, Predictability and
Environment. The report also presents an initial approach to quantifying
potential inefficiencies in terms of fuel burn and CO\textsubscript{2}
emissions.

\hypertarget{geographical-scope}{%
\section{Geographical Scope}\label{geographical-scope}}

The geographical scope of this report relates to Brazil and Europe.

Brazil is defined as the sovereign airspace of the national territory of
Brazil. In Brazil, airspace control is performed in an integrated
civil-military manner. The same institution performs both the air
defence and air traffic control functions: the Brazilian Air Force. The
Department of Airspace Control (DECEA) is a governmental organization
subordinated to the Brazilian Air Force Command. That Department
coordinates and provides human resources and technical equipment for all
air traffic units within Brazilian territory, ensuring the safety of air
traffic and, at the same time, contributing to military defence.

DECEA is the main body of the Brazilian Airspace Control System
(SISCEAB). The department is in charge of providing the Air Navigation
Services for the 22 million km\textsuperscript{2} of airspace
jurisdiction, including oceanic areas. The Brazilian airspace is
composed of 5 Flight Information Regions (FIR). Air traffic within these
FIRs is managed by 4 operational bases subordinated to DECEA. The areas
of responsibility of these integrated Centres for Air Defence and Air
Traffic Control (CINDACTA) are depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig-BRA-airspace}).

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.71in,height=\textheight]{././figures/BRAZIL_CINDACTA_AND_CRCEA.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-BRA-airspace}Brazilian Airspace Structure/FIRs
(CINDACTAs)}

\end{figure}

The CINDACTAs combine civil air traffic control and air defence military
operations. In addition to CINDACTAs, there is also the Regional Center
of Southeast Airspace Control (CRCEA-SE), which is responsible for
servicing air traffic for the high density air flow in the terminal
areas of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.09in,height=\textheight]{././figures/Europe-ECTRL.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-EUR-airspace}European Airspace and EUROCONTROL
Member States}

\end{figure}

In this report, Europe, i.e.~the European airspace, is defined as the
area where the 41 EUROCONTROL member states provide air navigation
services, excluding the oceanic areas and the Canary islands (c.f.
Figure~\ref{fig-EUR-airspace}). In 2016, EUROCONTROL signed a
comprehensive agreement with Israel and Morocco. Both comprehensive
agreement States will be successively fully integrated into the working
structures including performance monitoring. Within this report, these
states are included in the reported network traffic volume.\\
EUROCONTROL is an inter-governmental organisation working towards a
highly harmonized European air traffic management system. Air traffic
services are provided by air navigation service providers entrusted by
the different EUROCONTROL member states. Dependent on the local and
national regimes, there is a mix of civil and military service
providers, and integrated service provision. The Maastricht Upper Area
Control Center is operated by EUROCONTROL on behalf of 4 States
(Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Germany). It is the only
multi-national cross-border air traffic unit in Europe at the time
being. Given the European context and airspace structure, the European
area comprises 37 ANSPs with 62 en-route centres and 16 stand-alone
Approach Control Units (i.e.~totalling 78 air traffic service units).

Europe employs a collaborative approach to manage and service airspace
and air traffic. This includes the integration of military objectives
and requirements which need to be fully coordinated within the ATM
System. A variety of coordination cells/procedures exists between civil
air traffic control centres and air defence units reflecting the local
practices. Many EUROCONTROL member states are members of NATO and have
their air defence centres / processes for civil-military coordination
aligned under the integrated NATO air defence system.

Further details on the organisation of the regional air navigation
systems in Brazil and Europe will be provided in Section 2.1.

\hypertarget{study-airports}{%
\subsection{Study Airports}\label{study-airports}}

As concerns airport-related air navigation performance, this edition of
the comparison report addresses the performance at a set of selected
airports. These airports represent the top-10 or most relevant airports
in terms of IFR movements in both regions and allow to make meaningful
comparisons. In Brazil, the selected airports play a significant role in
terms of the national and regional connectivity, including the major
hubs for international air traffic. These study airports have
consolidated systems and structured processes for data collection in
support of this comparison report. For the European context, the study
airports comprise the busiest airports in several states exhibiting a
mix of national, regional, and international air traffic. These airports
are also characterised by varying operational constraints that make them
excellent candidates for an international comparison. All of these
airports are subject to the performance monitoring under the EUROCONTROL
Performance Review System and provide movement related data on the basis
of a harmonised data specification.

Figure Figure~\ref{fig-scope-airports} provides an overview of the
location of the chosen study airports within the regions. The airports
are also listed in \textbf{?@tbl-scopetable}.

\subsection{Temporal Scope}\label{temporal-scope}}

This report focuses mainly on the period from January 2019 through to
June 2021. Based on the initial report and data availability, a longer
time series (up to June 2022) will be presented, as far as practicable.
With this report the focus is on building a timeline with comparable
data to be augmented in future editions.

Throughout the report, summary statistics will be given with reference
to calendar years of this comparison study. It must be noted that the
data for 2022 covers the first six months, January through June.

\hypertarget{data-sources}{%
\section{Data Sources}\label{data-sources}}

The nature of the performance indicator requires the collection of data
from different sources. DECEA Performance Section and PRU investigated
the comparability of the data available in both regions, including the
data pre-processes, data cleaning and aggregation, to ensure a
harmonised set of data for performance comparison purposes.

DECEA mainly uses tower data from the main airports as a data source for
performance studies. This was combined with ANAC official and public
data for specific indicators. Each landing and take-off operation is
collected and provided automatically by the control tower system. The
provided data includes such items as the times of operations, gate entry
and exit, and flight origin and destination

Within the European context, PRU has established a variety of
performance-related data collection processes. For this report the main
sources are the European Air Traffic Flow Management System complemented
with airport operator data. The sources are combined to establish a
flight-by-flight record. This ensures consistent data for arrivals and
departures at the chosen study airports. The data is collected on a
monthly basis and typically processed for the regular performance
reporting under the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and the Single
European Sky Performance and Charging Scheme (EUROCONTROL 2019).

\chapter{Air Navigation System
Characterisation}\label{air-navigation-system-characterisation}}

This section provides a general overview of the Brazilian and European
air navigation system. In general terms, the provision of air navigation
services in Brazil and Europe are based on similar operational concepts,
procedures, and supporting technology. However, there exists a series of
differences between the two regional systems. These characteristics help
to explain the similarities and differences in terms of key performance
indicators observed throughout this report.

\hypertarget{organisation-of-air-navigation-services}{%
\section{Organisation of Air Navigation
Services}\label{organisation-of-air-navigation-services}}

A key difference between the Brazilian and European air navigation
system is the organisation of ANS in both regions. In Brazil there is
one air navigation services provider, while in Europe each member state
has assigned the service provision to national or local providers. To
date the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre is the only multi-national
air traffic service unit in Europe \footnote{On behalf of the four
  member states the EUROCONTROL Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre
  manages the upper airspace (from 24,500 to 66,000 feet) over Belgium,
  the Netherlands, Luxembourg and north-west Germany}. Network
functions, such as air traffic flow management and airspace management
are centrally planned/coordinated by the European Network Manager.

The Department of Airspace Control (DECEA) is responsible for the
management of all the activities related to the safety and efficiency of
the Brazilian airspace control. DECEA's mission is to manage and control
all air traffic in the sovereign Brazilian airspace and to contribute to
its defense. In that respect, DECEA operates a fully integrated
civil-military system. The airspace covers an area of approximately 22
million km\textsuperscript{2} (non-oceanic: 8.5 million
NM\textsuperscript{2}) and is organised into 5 Flight Information
Regions comprising 5 area control centres (ACC), 57 towers (TWR) and 42
approach units (APP) (c.f. Figure~\ref{fig-BRA-airspace}).

The European non-oceanic airspace spans over an area of 11.5 million
km\textsuperscript{2}. As concerns the provision of air traffic
services, the European approach results in a high number of service
providers, i.e.~there are 37 different en-route air navigation service
providers (ANSPs) with varying geographical areas of responsibility.
Next to a limited number of cross-border agreements between adjacent
airspaces and air traffic service units, air traffic service provision
is predominantly organised along state boundaries / FIR borders.
Maastricht UAC represents the only multi-national collaboration
providing air traffic services in the upper airspace of northern
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The level of
civil-military integration varies from country to country in Europe.
Within the European context, air traffic flow management (ATFM) and
airspace management (ASM) are provided/coordinated centrally through the
Network Manager. The design of airspace and related procedures is no
longer carried out or implemented in isolation in Europe. Inefficiencies
in the design and use of the air route network are considered to be a
contributing factor towards flight inefficiencies in Europe. Therefore
the development of an integrated European Route Network Design is one of
the tasks given to the Network Manager under the European Commission's
Single European Sky initiative. This is done through a collaborative
decision-making (CDM) process involving all stakeholders. A further task
of the Network Manager is to ensure and coordinate that traffic flows do
not exceed what can be safely handled by the air traffic service units
while trying to optimise the use of available and deployed capacity. For
this purpose, the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) monitors the
air traffic situation and proposes flow measures coordinated through a
CDM process with the respective local authorities. This coordination is
typically affected with the local flow management position (FMP) in an
area control centre. The NMOC implements then the respective flow
management initiative on request of the authority/FMP.

Similar to Europe, the Brazilian CGNA (Air Navigation Management
Centre), which is an organisation subordinated to DECEA, performs the
same functions as the European NMOC. CGNA manages the Brazilian air
traffic flows, applies ATFM measures and facilitates collaborative
decision-making with airlines, airports, control and approach centres.
In addition, CGNA also coordinates airspace management, the flight plan
handling system, the statistical database, and all activities related to
air navigation. In summary, CGNA provides the operational management of
ATM processes and related infrastructure, and ensures the availability
and quality of the services provided under the Brazilian Airspace
Control System (SISCEAB).

\hypertarget{high-level-system-comparison}{%
\section{High-Level System
Comparison}\label{high-level-system-comparison}}

Starting from an initial macro-comparison, it is evident that the
European environment is more complex. For example, while the European
non-oceanic airspace is about a quarter larger (26\%) than Brazil's
non-oceanic airspace, the number of 37 Air Navigation Services Providers
already shows a totally different system complexity in terms of ATM
operations compared to just one ANSP in Brazil. Figure~\ref{fig-test}
summarizes the key characteristics of the Brazilian and European air
navigation system for 2021. Both regions operate with similar
operational concepts, procedures and supporting technology. However,
Brazil, with lower traffic density, finds a more challenging
cost-benefit ratio to maintain communications coverage and surveillance
for low-traffic regions, while the European region faces more
considerable challenges in coordinating efforts to avoid congestion due
to a higher density.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth,height=\textheight]{././figures/Summary_Table_2021_Sep23.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-test}High-level comparison 2021}

\end{figure}

In terms of air traffic service provision, the comparison of the number
of APP and ACC facilities is less straightforward. Several relevant
differences can make conclusions difficult. While in Brazil each
Approach Unit (APP) is a stand alone ATC unit, the European model sees a
mix of stand alone and co-located units.\\
Next to the partial co-location of APP and ACC units in Europe, the
higher number of ACCs reflects the local/national focus of air traffic
service provision. This also becomes visible when comparing the total
number of ATCOs in operations. The number of ATCOs in Brazil ranges
around 20\% of the numbers of ATCOs in Europe. While a crude high-level
measure, the ratio of IFR movements per ATCO ranged at the same order of
magnitude in 2021 (+3\% in Brazil). In 2019 (pre-COVID) the European
ratio is about 20\% higher than in Brazil. This suggests that the
staffing situation in 2021 in comparison to the overall traffic
situation in both regions follows similar criteria. This needs to be
contrasted with the lower traffic density in Brazil (and overall lower
traffic levels). On average, the shift in traffic levels per volume of
airspace is significantly lower in Brazil than in Europe. This suggests
that the network connectivity in Brazil is more centralised than in
Europe (lower density of flights per km\textsuperscript{2} vs similar
average number of controlled flights per ATCO). The latter can also be
derived from the fact that the European network also entertains a high
share of intra-European traffic primarily servicing major hubs
(i.e.~capitals, business centres) between the European states.

\section{Regional Approaches to Operational Performance
Monitoring}\label{regional-approaches-to-operational-performance-monitoring}}

\hypertarget{europe}{%
\subsection{Europe}\label{europe}}

Within Europe, the Performance Review Commission (PRC) was created by
the EUROCONTROL States in 1998, following the adoption of the European
Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Institutional Strategy the previous
year. A key feature of this Strategy was that ``an independent
Performance Review System covering all aspects of ATM in the ECAC area
will be established to put greater emphasis on performance and improved
cost-effectiveness, in response to objectives set at a political
level''. Subsequently, the Performance Review Unit (PRU) was established
to support the work programme of the PRC. The major objective of the PRC
is to provide independent advice to the EUROCONTROL Permanent Commission
through the Provisional Council on pan-European ATM performance.

The EUROCONTROL PRC and PRU provide objective information and
independent advice based on extensive research, data analysis, and
consultation with the governing bodies and interested stakeholders on
all aspects of European air navigation performance. EUROCONTROL's
performance review system was a world-first at the time it was
established in the late 1990s.

The PRC's work has been built on in wider fora, such as ICAO's global
performance-based approach, and the performance scheme of the Single
European Sky (SES). The EUROCONTROL performance review system and the
SES performance scheme jointly contribute towards improving the overall
performance of air navigation services and network functions in Europe.
PRU also supports the European region efforts of ICAO under the Doc 030
performance framework.

International cooperation and supporting further harmonisation of air
navigation performance practices is one of the strategic objectives of
the PRC. Within this context, the PRC is engaging with ICAO and
international partners. This report is an outcome of the
DECEA/EUROCONTROL MoU and the cooperation in the field of operational
ANS performance. The findings of bi-lateral comparison reports are
carried forward under the umbrella of multi-lateral working arrangements
(e.g.~PBWG). Through this harmonisation validated approaches and methods
are proposed to ICAO's GANP Performance Expert Group.

Next to two major annual pan-European performance oriented publication,
i.e. ACE (ATM Cost Effectiveness) and PRR (Performance Review Report),
operational performance monitoring includes a series of indicator
specific data products (web-pages/dashboards, self-service reports).
Within the scope of this report, respective information on operational
performance be found at https://ansperformance.eu. The tab ``views''
provides access to data products related to the ones used in this
comparison study on airport, ANSP, and national level. It needs to be
noted that the indicator parameterisation used in this report differs
from the parameters used within the European performance monitoring
(e.g.~percentiles and time frame used for the determination of
associated reference time). Reported trends of this comparison report
are consistent with the regional monitoring, however, the actual values
of the indicator may vary. PRU is constantly expanding its online
reporting on performance to provide stakeholders with independent
performance monitoring data for their decision-making.

\hypertarget{brazil}{%
\subsection{Brazil}\label{brazil}}

The performance-based approach was adopted by DECEA as a consequence of
ICAO publications in the second half of the 2000s. The concept and this
form of planning gained more defined contours with the publication of
ICAO DOC 9883 - Manual on Global Performance of the Air Navigation
System, in 2009, following DOC 9854 - Global Air Traffic Management
Operational Concept, in 2005. DECEA established a project for the
development of Performance Management in 2012 within the initial
activities of the SIRIUS Brazil Program
(https://sirius.decea.mil.br/en/). However, essential details on the
definition, metrics, and, especially, the standardisation of indicators
were still a regional and global challenge.

Eventually, the effort and opportunity met with the signing of the
broad-purpose Cooperation Agreement between DECEA and EUROCONTROL in
2015 and the publication of ``Description of the potential Performance
Indicators presented in ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan 2016'', which
had a fundamental contribution from EUROCONTROL. On the basis of more
precise process objectives and requirements, DECEA accelerated its
transformation in search of organisational self-knowledge. Since 2017,
DECEA published an annual Performance Report and several comparative
reports, developed a series of training courses, and continuously
expanded the availability of data for performance monitoring purposes
including assciated analysis tools.

In 2019, DECEA's ATM Performance Section was born to manage and
coordinate activities related to performance management and represent
Brazil in international agreements and forums in this field. The setup
of the Performance Section was inspired by the Performance Review Unit
of EUROCONTROL. With a broad and dedicated virtual environment, the
Section publishes its products, data, and - in the future -
recommendations for the improvement of ATM Performance (See
https://performance.decea.mil.br/).

With increasing levels of expertise in operational performance
monitoring and maturity in data collection and processing, DECEA
published its first DECEA ATM Performance Plan 2022 - 2023
(https://publicacoes.decea.mil.br/publicaca/pca-100-3). The plan
comprises the identification and definition of performance goals for
twelve ICAO/Brazilian operational key performance indicators and
establishes the monitoring of five complementary performance indicators.
The release of this first plan is a key step in the roadmap of DECEA to
implement the performance based approach in Brazil.

The performance approach is mainly about an organization's past outcomes
compared to its present and future results. However, the comparisons
between peers in the universe of air navigation service improve
methodologies and present opportunities for advances that would not be
identified otherwise.

Within the South American region, DECEA actively promotes the open
culture of trust and sharing in operational performance monitoring
catalysed by the relationship with EUROCONTROL. In June 2022, DECEA was
invited to coordinate a Workshop with the ICAO SAM Regional Office.
Participants from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela exchanged experiences and lessons
learned with speakers from DECEA. In late 2022, DECEA will promote a
Performance Seminar in the technological cluster of São José dos Campos,
Brazil, the host city of the Aeronautics Technological Institute, one of
the event's supporters. EUROCONTROL was invited to participate as a
partner in the seminar by sending speakers.

DECEA embraces the culture of collaboration and sharing perennially.
DECEA made its indicators and databases easily accessible on public
dashboards, available at
https://performance.decea.mil.br/produtos/dashboard/). Thus, DECEA
intends to carry forward the culture of reciprocity and transparency
that has been presenting consistent results and benefiting the entire
aviation community.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

This chapter has shown high-level similarities and differences between
both regions. The non-oceanic airspace in Brazil is about a quarter
smaller than in Europe and is serviced by about 40\% less air traffic
service units (APP and ACC, Brazil: 47 vs Europe: 78). While on average
traffic levels in Brazil ranged in 2019 and 2021 at 20\% of the European
air traffic, the number of ATCOs is commensurate with the traffic levels
and difference in ATCO staffing numbers in Brazil and Europe.\\
The latter is also evidenced by the similar ratio of air traffic
serviced vs numbers of ATCOs in operations in 2021. This suggests that
traffic density and complexity during peak times at major hubs in Brazil
may be comparable to Europe. More research is needed to asses the
overall network composition in both regions. The general spread in
numbers highlights that the European system is still dominated by a more
nationally oriented approach to air traffic service provision, while
Brazil benefits from a single ANSP set up.

The chapter also provides a summary of the regional approach to
operational performance monitoring. The Performance Section of DECEA and
EUROCONTROL's PRU are actively collaborating on the international level
to foster the understanding and application of the ICAO GANP performance
framework, and drive the further developments and implementation in both
regions. Both groups intend to deepen its cooperation in the future by
expanding the scope of this bi-regional comparison report and the joint
multi-lateral work.

\hypertarget{traffic-characterisation}{%
\chapter{Traffic Characterisation}\label{traffic-characterisation}}

The overarching objective of air traffic services is the provision of
safe, orderly, and efficient flow of air traffic. Accordingly,
operational system performance is linked to the actual and serviced
demand (i.e.~air traffic). It must be noted that the serviced traffic
may be different from the actual demand. Constraints, both on the
airspace user and air navigation system side may lead to unsatisfied
demand. However, the level of these changes is outside the scope of this
comparison.\\
For operational comparisons, it is therefore important to have a good
understanding of the level and composition of the air traffic. The
previous section provided the high-level context and organisation of air
navigation services in Brazil and Europe. This chapter establishes some
key air traffic characteristics for both regions to frame the observed
operational performance in latter parts of the report.

\hypertarget{annualtraffic}{%
\section{Annual Traffic}\label{annualtraffic}}

Figure~\ref{fig-timeline-region-mvts} shows the regional traffic
development in Brazil and Europe. Pre-COVID air traffic in Brazil showed
only mild variation across the year \footnote{For Brazil, the depicted
  volume of air traffic is the sum of all movements at the study
  airports. This captures a significant share of the total traffic and
  shows the overall development.}. This is in contrast to the strong
seasonal nature of air traffic in Europe and its peaking behaviour
during the summer months of 2019. In both regions, the unprecedented
decline in air traffic occurred in March 2019 in the aftermath of the
pandemic-declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic-characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-timeline-region-mvts-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-timeline-region-mvts}Timeline of regional air
traffic}

\end{figure}

To understand the magnitude of the impact of COVID on air traffic,
Figure~\ref{fig-norm-timeline} depicts the regional traffic in a
normalised form. The reference level for the normalisation is set at the
90th percentile of the traffic observed in 2019. The initial drop in
traffic due to COVID-related travel constraints started a few days
earlier in Europe. This was related to the reaction of several air
transport operators to limit their flights to Asia. Furthermore, some
European states already responded to the initial surge of infections in
anticipation of the declaration by the WHO.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic-characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-norm-timeline-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-norm-timeline}Normalised daily traffic in Brazil and
Europe}

\end{figure}

Both regions responded initially similar to the world wide restrictions
for air travel in combination with immediate regional health measures
following the declaration by the WHO. The traffic declined in both
regions in the order of magnitude of about 80-90\%. While traffic in
March through May 2020 showed a similar pattern, Europe experienced a
higher share of air traffic in June, July and August of 2020. Traffic
levels in Brazil grew gradually and consistently in 2020 and broke even
with Europe in the early autumn. At that point in time Europe was facing
a second wave of infections following an initial relaxation of health
constraints to facilitate the summer vacation season. In consequence,
governments had to impose again restrictions on the regional traffic to
curb the further spread. While air traffic in Europe declined, traffic
in Brazil continued its initial recovery until the end of 2020. In both
regions the spikes (twin peaks) of the seasonal Christmas and New Year's
traffic are visible. A significant change in the pattern developed with
the beginning of 2021. Following the seasonal pattern, Europe observed a
continual increase in air traffic as of end January/beginning February
2021 and a strong recovery to about the 65-70\% pre-COVID level ensued.
The pattern of air traffic was different in Brazil. After having reached
a level of about 65\% at the end of 2020, Brazil also faced a second
wave of COVID infections in early 2021. This resulted in a distinct
reduction over the first 6 weeks in 2021 followed by a similar recovery
rate throughout March and April 2021. Both regions reached 65-70\% of
their pre-COVID traffic levels in April and May 2021. While traffic
continuously increased in Brazil, Europe saw another wave post-summer
2021. Traffic levels reached the pre-COVID 90\% (and higher level) in
Brazil in early 2022. With the continual relaxation of travel
constraints for inner-European traffic in early 2022, Europe also
reached the 85\% pre-COVID level with July 2022.

In general, the gradual recovery over 2020 and 2021 also suffered severe
setbacks by the subsequent reappearances of the virus characterised by
the subsequent waves (i.e.~ripples) in Figure~\ref{fig-norm-timeline}.
Comparing both regions, the recovery patterns of the two regions show a
coherent central tendency, with relevant differences according to the
season or increased regional health measures (i.e.~travel restrictions).
It is pertinent to note that European air traffic was more sensitive to
the effects of winter and summer, reflecting the holiday seasons and
climatic variations. It is interesting to note, that the Brazilian
system shows little sensitivity to calendrical and seasonal effects.

By the time of the publication of this report (October 2022), the world
economy and global air transportation is still recovering. There is
growing confidence that COVID transitioned from its pandemic stage to an
endemic stage. By the end of 2021, traffic volume was 26\% and 25.5\%
higher for Brazil and Europe compared to 2020. The Brazilian Gross
Domestic Product grew by 4.6\% in 2021 and the World Bank's estimate for
2022 is a growth of 1.4\%. The European market has shown a 5.4\% GDP
\footnote{Source: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat} increase for EU in
2021. The traffic volume of 2019 is expected to be reached towards end
2023 or beginning of 2024 for both regions, if the economic activity
keeps on track.

\hypertarget{study-airport-level-traffic}{%
\section{Study Airport Level
Traffic}\label{study-airport-level-traffic}}

The previous section showed the traffic development on the network level
and Airports, in turn, represent nodes in this overall network. Thus,
changes in the overall traffic situation will ripple down to the airport
level. However, connectivity and type of traffic may differ from airport
to airport. It is therefore useful to understand how traffic developed
locally on the level of the selected study airports.

\begin{figure}[h]

}

\caption{\label{fig-viz-annualvar}Movements at study airports in both
regions}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-viz-annualvar} shows the variation of air traffic across
the study airports. On average, the annual traffic at the Brazilian
airports in 2020 and 2021 ranged about 45\% respectively 47\% lower than
in 2019. The European study airports observed a higher decrease. The
airports serviced -60\% in 2020 and -55\% in 2021. The airports of this
study had been selected based on their role in the regional networks.
While the numbers vary slightly, a similar pattern is observed in Brazil
and Europe. This suggests that the traffic related pressure on air
traffic services behaved in a similar fashion. This observation will be
relevant for the following chapters. Considering all 10 airports per
region may however mask varying behaviour at different airports. It is
important to note that the pandemic affected both sets of 10 airports
more severely than their national levels, recalling that Brazil closed
2021 with -20\% and EUR with -43\% compared to 2019 overall aircraft
movement.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-annual-tfc-var} shows the annual traffic observed at the
study airports in 2021 and the associated annual variation of traffic
comparing 2020 and 2021. On average, traffic levels at all airports in
both regions increased following the initial drop in 2019. But there are
notable exemptions.\\
São Paulo/Guarulhos (SBGR) in Brazil and London Heathrow (EGLL) in
Europe show a similar lagging recovery. This reflects the high share of
international air traffic serviced at both airports. Both airports
observed an about -5\% lower traffic on an annual basis in 2021 than in
2020. Almost -10\% lower traffic was observed in 2021 in comparison to
2020 at Curitiba (SBCT).This drop may be related to the strong
connection between Curitiba and the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires,
which faced more severe travel restrictions due to COVID. London Gatwick
(EGKK) serviced about -30\% less traffic in 2021 than in 2020, probably
reflecting the UK's more severe anti-COVID restrictions at that time.
Traffic levels in 2021 at SBGR and São Paulo/Congonhas (SBSP) range in
the order of magnitude of the less busy airports in the top-10 of
Europe.

\hypertarget{peak-day-traffic}{%
\section{Peak Day Traffic}\label{peak-day-traffic}}

While the annual traffic provides insights in the total air traffic
volume and associated demand, it does not provide insights on the upper
bound of achievable daily movement numbers. The latter depends on
demand, operational procedures and constraints, and the use of the
runway system infrastructure. The peak day traffic is determined as the
99th percentile of the total number of daily movements (arrivals and
departures). The measure represents thus an upper bound for comparison
purposes.

Figure~\ref{fig-peak-day99} shows the peak day traffic in 2019 with
reference to the number of runways.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./03-traffic-characterisation_files/figure-pdf/fig-peak-day99-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-peak-day99-var}Variation of Peak day traffic over
time}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-peak-day99} shows the peak day traffic in 2021. Peak
traffic at the 2-runway airports Guarulhos (SBGR) and São Paulo
Congonhas (SBSP) in Brazil and London Heathrow (EGLL) and Munich (EDDM)
in Europe achieve similar or higher peak numbers than airport with more
runways. It's valid to note that Campinas (SBKP) and Salvador (SBSV)
were stable due to an already low traffic concentration regarding per
day granularity.

For European with more than 2 runways it needs to be noted that the
runway system does not support independent operations of all available
runways. Thus, the serviced peak traffic is also impacted by the runway
system configuration. Peak operations as SBGR range in the same order of
magnitude than Munich (EDDM) and exceed the peak movement observed in
Zurich (LSZH, 3 runway system) or Rome Fiumincino (LIRF, 4 runway
system).

Figure~\ref{fig-timeline-region-mvts} and Figure~\ref{fig-norm-timeline}
depict the decline in air traffic with the start of the COVID pendemic
in March 2020 at the same moment in both regions. However in terms of
peak movements the seasonal difference between Brazil and Europe become
more visible in Figure Figure~\ref{fig-peak-day99-var}. While in Europe
a sharp drop in peak day traffic is already observed for the year 2020,
the respective peak day movements in the first 3 month in 2020 in Brazil
range in the same number than the years before. The recovery seen in
2021 movements did not reflect at Peak Days. The distribution was more
equalized, resulting in lower peaks.

\hypertarget{fleet-mix}{%
\section{Fleet Mix}\label{fleet-mix}}

The fleet mix - and in particular the separation requirements between
the different aircraft types - is an important influencing factor for
the capacity and observed (and realisable) throughput. In particular,
aircraft with longer runway occupancy times or larger proportions of
heavy aircraft may result in lower throughout due to the larger wake
turbulence separations. The locally defined capacity values may
therefore differ based on the predominant fleet mix and operational
characteristics, and ultimately result in different observed Peak Day
movement numbers.

Figure~\ref{fig-fleet-mix} depicts the observed share of different wake
turbulence categories (WTC) across the study airports in 2021. In both
regions, ``medium'' aircraft types are the predominant aircraft type.\\
On average, airports in Europe observed a higher share of ``heavy''
aircraft in 2021. In Brazil, Guarulhos (SBGR) and Campinas (SBKP)
serviced a noticeable share of ``heavy'' aircraft of around 12\% which
is comparable to the share at Zurich (LSZH). In Brazil, ``light'' types
play a larger role at the study airports than on the European side. The
fleet mix at SBGR and SBKP showed a similar pattern (high share of
medium, discernible share of heavy, and shallow share of light types) as
observable at European airports. The heavy category represents wide-body
passenger aircraft and full cargo flights. Within the European region -
and its multitude of national hubs - a significant number of
international long-haul flights is operated at the chosen study
airports. In Brazil, the highlighted airports, Guarulhos (SBGR) and
Campinas (SBKP), play a major role in terms of international
connectivity. It follows that medium and light types are used for
inter-reginal connections. Based on the selected study airports, the
underlying decentralised structure of the European network becomes more
visible. While international air traffic is centralised in Brazil with 2
pre-dominant hubs, capital or main national hubs are more frequent in
Europe. London Heathrow (EGLL) is a noteworthy exemption. The level of
international connectivity can be derived from a 50\% share of heavy
types.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-fleet-evo-bra} and Figure~\ref{fig-fleet-evo-eur} depict
the evolution of the annual fleet mix for the years 2019 through 2021
for nine of the study airports in both regions \footnote{To increase
  readability of the visualisation an airport with low variability has
  been removed from the figure for both regions.}. Two principal
patterns emerge: (i) airports with COVID-related contraction of traffic,
i.e.~the reduction in overall traffic in 2020 and 2019 did not influence
the relative share of aircraft types serviced at the airport, and (ii)
airport with a reduction of the share of ``heavy'' aircraft and increase
of the relative share of ``medium'' or ``light'' types.\\
With the exception of Zurich (LSZH) in Europe, ``light'' types did not
feature widely. There appears to be a reciprocal relationship between
the relative share of ``heavy'' and ``medium'' types utilised in Europe.
At major hubs (e.g.~EDDF, EGLL, EHAM, LFPG) the ratio of ``heavy''
aircraft increased across the years.\\
The fleet mix in Brazil showed a different pattern. While the share of
``heavy'' types remained on average constant across the period 2019
through 2021, lower shares of ``medium'' types resulted in higher
utilisation rate of ``light'' types.

For future reports it will be interesting to investigate also the
connectivity in terms of operated aerodrome pairs and aircraft types.

Figure~\ref{fig-bra-fleet-mix-timeline} and
Figure~\ref{fig-eur-fleet-mix-timeline} focus on the temporal evolution
of the fleet mix on a rolling weekly basis (7-days) for heavy and medium
type aircraft. This shows a more varied behaviour across all airports.

}

\caption{\label{fig-eur-fleet-mix-timeline}Evolution of fleet mix at
selected European airports}

\end{figure}

The synchronicity of the relative reduction and increase can be observed
at all European airports. The overall traffic pattern at these airports
followed the overall traffic development in Europe for the observed
period. The increased share of heavy aircrafts may reflect the
resilience of cargo flights over the pandemic. Zurich (LSZH) - based on
a structurally overall lower share of heavy aircraft and on the presence
of a good share of light types - showed a pattern that reflected the
overall trends. With a lower share of heavy aircraft for most Brazilian
airports, the evolution of the medium type share follows the overall
traffic development in Brazil. The decline in March 2020 is
characteristic. For example, in Sao Paulo (SBSP) - with a negligible
share of heavy aircraft - the share of medium aircraft mirrors the
overall trend in Brazil. This shows that SBSP predominantly serviced
domestic or short-range traffic. That is somehow expected for São Paulo
(SBSP) and Rio de Janeiro (SBRJ) since their runaway length and airport
infrastructure are not suitable for heavies, but it is interesting to
note that other Brazilian airports such as Brasília, Confins and
Curitiba, which can accommodate heavies, do not serve a significant
number of these aircraft. That is a good opportunity for future studies
and explorations.

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

This chapter described the overall evolution of air traffic in Brazil
and Europe and offered a closer look at the selected subset of study
airports. Both regions observed a unprecedented decline in air traffic
in March 2020 in response to COVID. However, the response pattern
differed. Both regions observed COVID waves resulting in measures to
limit air travel and curb the spread of COVID. Despite these waves, the
Brazilian system recovered more consistently in structural terms. This
shows the effect of the additional coordination and harmonisation effort
of policies in Europe. As national governments varied in their
assessment and introduction of health measures, including travel
restrictions.

An intersting observation is that despite the overall variation of
traffic on regional and local level, the share of operated aircraft
types varied to a lesser extent on an annual level. However, distinct
patterns become visible on the airport level. A central factor is the
difference in terms of network connectivity and the role of the selected
study airports. Based on the historic context, there exists a higher
number of national hubs across Europe. In Brazil, international and
cargo air traffic are more centralised and primarily operated to/from
SBGR and SBKP. This can be obsered based on the differences of shares of
heavy types (predominantly wide-body aircraft = long-haul international
and cargo traffic).

These differences may impact - amongst others - separation and
throughput. This chapter also highlighted potential areas for further
research to better qualify the level of network and pan-regional
connectivity.

\hypertarget{predictability}{%
\chapter{Predictability}\label{predictability}}

The previous chapters showed distinct responses by both systems to the
overall air transport developments. Predictability in the system affects
operations in both the strategic phase when airline schedules are
produced and in the operating phase when ANSPs and stakeholders are
balancing demand and capacity. High levels of predictability will
benefit ANSPs servicing airspace users with a view to achieving highly
efficient operations also during peak periods. This report focuses on
the arrival and departure punctuality as measures of predictability.

\caption{\label{fig-arrivalpunc}Evolution of arrival punctuality at
study airports in both regions}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-arrivalpunc} shows the evolution of arrival punctuality
for the select airports in Brazil and Europe. In 2019, about 70\% of
flights arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival time on
average in both regions. This raises concerns about schedule stability
with a share of about 30\% of flights arriving either well before 15
minutes or late when compared to the schedule. However, the punctual
portion of the flights was further compressed in 2020, with the crisis
peak. This share noticed a brief relief in 2021, with demand resuming
its historical levels. The Brazilian data showed a soft advantage in the
last year. On average a higher share of traffic at European airports
arrives within + 15 minutes late of the scheduled arrival time. Within
the European region, arrival punctuality decreased in 2020 with a higher
share of early arrivals at all airports. The lower arrival punctuality
was also characteristic for arrivals in 2020 in Brazil. TThe larger
airports in Brazil, São Paulo/Guarulhos (SBGR), São Paulo/Congonhas
(SBSP), Campinas (SBKP), and Rio de Janeiro Galeão (SBGL) observed a
higher share of non-punctual arrivals (more/less than 15 minutes
compared to the scheduled arrival time). A similar behaviour was also
observed in 2021 across the Brazilian airports. In Europe, the schedule
reliability has been improved for late arrivals, notably Rome (LIRF) in
2020 and Barcelona (LEBL) in 2021. However, pre-COVID levels have not
been fully achieved. It is interesting to observe flights arriving well
before their scheduled arrival time. Despite increasing end-user
satisfaction, early arrivals did not reflect a healthy system and did
contribute to a certain degree of inefficiency in the use of airspace
and ground infrastructure due to the lack of predictability. Across the
airports this portion of flights varies. However, on average, about
20-30\% of flights arrived more than 15 minutes before their scheduled
arrival time. The associated pattern and share varied across the
2019-2021 horizon. For a future report it will be interesting to
investigate how structural this pattern is (i.e.~which connections or
service types showed this behaviour). Early arrivals may pose problems
to the service delivery as available runway, apron, and stand capacity
may negatively impact the management of the arrival flow.
Figure~\ref{fig-earlyarrs} highlights the share of arrivals with more
than 15 minutes compared to the scheduled arrival time. For the European
region, the significant lower load on the system is visible. Early
arrivals increased roughly doubled in 2020 compared to 2019 and
contracted again with 2021 and the overall higher traffic levels. This
pattern is more diverse at the Brazilian study airports. This suggests
that on average a higher level of flights arrive well ahead of their
scheduled time.

\hypertarget{departure-punctuality}{%
\section{Departure Punctuality}\label{departure-punctuality}}

This section analyses the level of departure punctuality. The previous
section showed that the overall traffic situation during the previous
years impacted the reliability of schedules for arrivals. Though the
overall pattern represented a decline in traffic due to COVID, early
arrivals may impact and put an additional strain on the infrastructure
(runway system, apron, and stands).

\caption{\label{fig-deppunc}Evolution of departure punctuality at study
airports in both regions}

\end{figure}

When looking at the interval of -/+15 minutes between actual off-block
time and scheduled off-block time, a different pattern than on the
arrival side emerges. On average, about 50\% of all flights depart
within that interval in Europe, with 2019 presenting a sightly larger
share of punctual flights while 2020 and 2021 showed a noticeable
decreasing in late departures.

For the European airports higher shares of early departures were
observed in 2020 and 2021. While schedule reliability improved in 2021
vs 2020, the pre-COVID levels were not reached at the European airports.
This suggests that there are still constraints surrounding the
facilitation of passengers and turn-around at the airports. London
Heathrow (EGLL) was the most affected European Airport, having its
punctual portion compressed by the extremes shares.

The Brazilian side did not show relevant variations in takeoff
punctuality, with early departures (-15 min) barely changing. Actually,
there is a negligible number of departure that blocked off less than 15
minutes early.\\
Interestingly this behavior was not impacted by the distortion of
traffic during the COVID phase. However, a soft improvement in late
departures (+15 min) is noticed. 2021 performed slightly better than
2020, even with significantly more traffic. Galeão (SBGL) presented the
worst indicator in all years but improved throughout the period.\\
In general, departures in 2020 and 2021 showed similar levels than in
2019.

The following figure highlights the share of late departures across the
years. The unprecedented decline in air traffic resulted in significant
lower shares of late departures decreased at the all studied airports in
2020 in comparison to 2019. Comparing the difference between 2021 and
2020 shows a similar structural pattern across all European airports.
The number of late departures increased in comparison to the peak
COVID-year 2020. This may be linked to two drivers. On one hand traffic
levels increased again with more states reducing restrictions on air
travel while still passenger screening and health measures required
heightened processes. In Brazil, higher levels of departure punctuality
were observed. Although the change from 2020 to 2021 ranges in the oder
of magnitude of under 5\%, the same pattern was obsered at all Brazilian
airports.

\hypertarget{summary-2}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-2}}

Arrival and departure punctuality play an important role in terms of
balancing demand and capacity. Punctuality in this chapter is measured
as the difference between the actual arrival/departure times versus the
respective scheduled times. This also reflects the stability and
planning accuracy of the schedule in terms of air navigation services.
Distinct patterns were observed in both regions. For example, on average
about 50\% of all flights arrive and depart within a window of -/+15
minutes in Europe. The influence of slot control is more visible with
the demand level of 2019.\\
On the other hand, a higher share of flights depart within -/+5 minutes
of their schedule in Brazil.

In both regions, the impact of the decline of air traffic is observable
in the predictability in 2020 and 2021. However, there are different
patterns in Brazil than in Europe. Europe showed a stronger reaction in
terms of early arrivals (i.e.~arriving more than 15 minutes before
schedule) and departures (departing later than 15 minutes after the
scheduled departure time). Traffic at Brazilian airports showed a
similar reaction to the declining traffic in 2020 only in the arrival
phase. The departure flights did not showed significant change in their
punctuality. The behavior in 2021 is still far from the 2019 pattern in
both regions. However, it appears that returning air traffic and load on
the system drives the move towards pre-COVID levels in Europe. For
example, the share of arrivals punctuality in 2021 ranges closer to the
2019 levels (i.e.~Guarulhos SBGR, and Heathrow EGLL). Early arrivals, in
its turn, doubled in Europe when comparing 2020 to 2019 level, and
dropped again in 2021 broadly reversing the trend while not reaching
2019 levels.

This suggests that there is higher uncertainty in terms of movements
with the returning traffic in both regions. More research is needed to
investigate the underlying drivers and to what extent regional
connectivity influences these behaviors.

\hypertarget{capacity-and-throughput}{%
\chapter{Capacity and Throughput}\label{capacity-and-throughput}}

A proper balance between airport capacity and flight demand is paramount
to an adjusted network flow. This section addresses the capacity and
throughput dimensions as measured by a variety of KPIs at the airport
level. Airspace users expect sufficient capacity provision addressing
the levels of demand. With higher levels of capacity utilisation,
airspace users will experience congestion and constraints (e.g.~higher
inefficiency, c.f. previous chapter). However, planning and staffing for
peak situations may come at significant costs to airspace user as well.
In that respect it is essential to understand the trade-off between
capacity provision and capacity consumption (i.e.~traffic demand) as it
impacts the overall system performance. Capacity and throughput analyses
are therefore showing to what extent air navigation services are capable
to accommodate the demand.

\hypertarget{peak-declared-capacity}{%
\section{Peak Declared Capacity}\label{peak-declared-capacity}}

Peak Declared Capacity refers to the highest movement rate (arrivals and
landings) at an airport using the most favourable runway configuration
under optimal conditions. The capacity value might be subject to local
or national decision-making processes. The indicator represents the
highest number of landings an airport can accept in a one-hour period.

In Brazil, the peak capacity is determined by DECEA considering local
operational constraints. Within the European region, the airport
capacity is determined locally or nationally as part of the capacity
declaration process. This considers local operational constraints
(e.g.~political caps, noise quota and abatement procedures),
infrastructure related limitations (e.g.~apron/stand availability,
passenger facilities). The declaration process considers typically IMC
separation minima for runway movements. \footnote{The Brazilian airports
  that have more than one operational runway are: Brasília (SBBR) with 2
  independent runways; Guarulhos (SBGR) with 2 parallel runways
  (simultaneous but not independent operations); and Galeão (SBGL),
  Curitiba (SBCT) and Salvador (SBSV) with 2 intersecting runways.}

All European airports in this study are Category 3 - fully slot
controlled. The slot and capacity declaration process is undertaken on
the local or national level. Throughout the last years additional
political caps in terms of maximum number of annual movements
(e.g.~Amsterdam (EHAM) movement cap of 500.000 commercial operations) or
permissible night and day time restrictions (e.g.~London Heathrow night
operation cap) have been introduced widely. Accordingly, capacity values
in Europe vary despite the local runway system capabilities. \footnote{Amsterdam
  (EHAM) operates at fixed capacity with 6 runways, London Heathrow has
  maximised the runway throughput with 2 independent runways, Gatwick
  airport is reportedly the most efficient single runway operation in
  Europe.}

Throughout the last years, no substantial change in the declared
capacity was observed at European airports. In Brazil, on the other
hand, 2019 showed a revised capacity declaration for most of the
airports throughout the country, c.f. Figure
Figure~\ref{fig-capsovertime}).

Since the end 2018, CGNA worked on the enhancement of the methodology
for the determination of the runway system capacity. The previous
methodology used conservative limitations for the declaration of airport
capacity. Capacity was limited to the maximum of 80\% of its real value
due to additional parameters taken into account (e.g.~local specifics).
The best practice approach included a 50\%-50\% division between
arrivals and departures. The process and refined analysis methodology
has evolved in such ways that these mentioned concepts are no longer in
use. The capacity is declared on the basis of its actual value
considering all variables that can restrain and impact the achievable
capacity. It is applied in accordance with the operational conditions at
the airport or the prevailing meteorological condition.

These changes significantly increased runway systems capacity for most
of Brazilian airports. Airports such as SBGR, SBGL, SBCF, SBBR and SBSV
benefited from the changes made, including changes in their runway
system configurations. CGNA continues developing enhancements to the
runway capacity analysis process. This resulted in the publication of a
refined process by the end of 2020. The impact of the revision will
likely influence the Brazilian airport capacity declaration.

Figure~\ref{fig-peakcapacity} the peak declared capacity per hour for
each of the study airports in Europe and Brazil in 2021. In general, the
declared capacity for all airports in Europe exceeds the respective
declared capacity levels in Brazil.

The peak capacity for Brasília (SBBR) approached to Munich (EDDM) and
Heathrow (EGLL) due to the implantation of independent operarions and
the methodology calculation review. Those tree airports, with similar
layout, show bigger capacity than Barcelona e Zurich which have tree
runway. Galeão (SBGL) and Guarulhos (SBGR) are now above the peak
capacity declared for the single-runway airport Gatwick (EGKK). But
still, the declared capacity values at those airports ranged around 50\%
of the major hubs in Europe, i.e.~Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG),
Amsterdam (EHAM), and Frankfurt (EDDF).

As mentioned before, the capacity process takes into account a variety
of local considerations. A potential avenue for further research could
be a closer investigation of the variances of the declared capacity in
line with the local runway system characteristics.

\hypertarget{peak-arrival-throughput}{%
\section{Peak Arrival Throughput}\label{peak-arrival-throughput}}

The peak arrival throughput measures the 95th percentile of the hourly
number of landings observed at an airport. The measure gives an
indication of the ``busy-hour'' landing rates. It is an indication to
what extent arrival traffic is serviced at an airport. For congested
airports, the throughput provides a measure of the effectively realized
capacity. Throughput is a measure of demand and comprises already air
traffic flow or sequencing measures applied by ATM or ATC in the
en-route and terminal phase. For non-congested airports, throughput
serves as a measure of showing the level of (peak) demand at this
airport. Unlike the day Peak Day indicator, the busiest hour of the
airports under study did not suffer a significant reduction in their
values even with the crisis. The demand peak during the last two years
and the natural tendency of traffic concentration in more attractive
hours were enough to keep the values at level with the historical data.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./05-capacity_files/figure-pdf/fig-arr-thru-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-arr-thru}Variation of arrival throughput at study
airports}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-arr-thru} shows a constant behaviour of the peak arrival
throughput across the whole time horizon. A noteworthy exemption is
Brasilia (SBBR). At SBBR, a reduction of the peak arrival throughput was
observed in 2019 in comparison to the previous year. Brasilia Airport
started independent operations on its two runways back in 2016. As a
result - and after a period of standardisation of procedures for aircrew
and controllers - its traffic was possibly better dispersed throughout
the day.

For the majority of the European airports, Figure~\ref{fig-arr-thru}
depicts little variation over the years. These study airports represent
the busiest 10 airports and accordingly the peak arrival throughput per
hour presents an upper limit based on the airspace user demand and
traffic patterns. The increase observed in peak arrival throughput at
Paris (LFPG), Madrid (LEMD), Rome (LIRF), and Munich (EDDM) was in line
with additional demand during peak hours. The continual increase in peak
arrival throughput signals a potential concentration of feeder flights
for international / long-range traffic.

The relative constant pattern of the peak arrival throughput observed
for many airports suggests that traffic patterns during the busiest
hours remained fairly constant. Potential changes to the airspace user
demand widely occurred outside the peak hours. This suggests that
arrival management of air traffic services in Brazil and Europe is able
to sustain the observed demand.

\hypertarget{peak-departure-throughput}{%
\section{Peak Departure Throughput}\label{peak-departure-throughput}}

In analogy to the arrival throughput, the departure throughput is
determined as the 95th percentile of the hourly number of departures.
The measure serves as an indication of the ``busy-hour'' departure
rates. As seen in the previous indicator, the pandemic crisis did not
influence the values significantly.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./05-capacity_files/figure-pdf/fig-dep-thru-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dep-thru}Variation of departure throughput at study
airports}

\end{figure}

The peak departure throughput at the study airports shows a similar
behaviour than the behaviour observed for the arrival throughput (c.f.
above). This suggests widely homogeneous demand patterns,
i.e.~schedules, across the different seasons.

Peak departure throughput at SBBR showed a similar decrease as for the
arrival peak throughput as reported above.

In Europe, Rome (LIRF) saw a drop in departure throughput in 2017 as
well, which then remained fairly constant until 2019. The observed
decrease is linked to a de-peaking of the outbounds. Frankfurt (EDDF)
and Madrid (LEMD) experienced a step as of 2019 that is in line with
additional routes served. The annual traffic increase observed at Paris
(LFPG) resulted in an increase in the peak departure throughput
accommodating these additional flights also during peak hours. The
observed systematic constant performance levels at Heathrow (EGLL),
Gatwick (EGKK), Barcelona (LEBL), and Zurich (LSZH) evidences that these
airports and air traffic services operated at their capacity limits
during peak hours throughout the time horizon of this report.

\hypertarget{declared-capacity-and-peak-throughput}{%
\section{Declared Capacity and Peak
Throughput}\label{declared-capacity-and-peak-throughput}}

Effective utilisation of the deployed capacity during peak times drives
operational efficiency. In this initial comparison report, the
difference between the peak arrival rate and the declared capacity is
analysed in order to demonstrate which airports have more and less
``slack'' between the peak movement levels and their capacity.
Figure~\ref{fig-capvsthru} orders all study airports based on their
declared arrival capacities and compares these values with the observed
peak arrival throughput.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./05-capacity_files/figure-pdf/fig-capvsthru-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-capvsthru}Comparison of declared capacity and
throughput for arrival phase.}

\end{figure}

For the majority of the airports, the approximated arrival capacity is
higher than the observed peak throughput. In Europe, Amsterdam (EHAM),
Frankfurt (EDDF), and Munich (EDDM) showed a higher peak throughput than
the respective declared capacity. Peak arrival operations at Zurich
(LSZH) were slightly higher than the declared capacity. In Brazil, the
realised peak arrival throughput at Sao Paulo (SBSP) exceeded the
capacity value as well. At these airports, it appears that during the
peak hours (i.e.~the top 5\% of all hourly arrivals) in 2021 better than
declared arrival throughputs were realised. This might be linked to the
methodology used for the capacity declaration process following a more
modulated approach and accounting for a wider varied aircraft mix. It
will be interesting to research in future comparisons how the peak hour
demand is managed in comparison to less busier hours and its underlying
driving factors.

\hypertarget{summary-3}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-3}}

The maximum capacities of Brazilian airports tend to be lower than the
declared capacities at European airports. Throughout the past years,
Brazil changed its methodology to identify and declare arrival and
departure capacities. In light of this change and on the basis of
operational improvements, Brazilian airports have been showing
consistent growth in their capacities. This growth of traffic is widely
completed for the top 10 airports in Europe and the associated
capacities were constant over the past years.

Another highlight is the resilience of peak hours against demand
variations. Despite the unprecendented decline of air traffic due to
COVID19, demand remained concentrated during peak operating hours. On
average, the declared arrival capacity is commensurate with the peak
traffic observed at the airports. This suggests that runway system
capacities is not a limitation for servicing traffic demand in both
regions.

\hypertarget{efficiency}{%
\chapter{Efficiency}\label{efficiency}}

Operational efficiency is a critical component in assessing the
management and execution of operations. It provides insights in the
management of arrival and departure flows and the associated separation
and synchronisation activities. Inefficiencies can have an impact on
user operations in terms of delays or excessive fuel burn.

The measures reported in this study are based on the observed travel
time for surface operations (i.e.~taxi-in and taxi-out) and during the
arrival phase. These travel times are compared with an associated
reference time for a group of flights showing similar operational
characteristics. The determined difference (i.e.~additional times)
measures the level of inefficiencies. It must be noted that high
performance operations will still yield a certain share of measured
additional times. Operational efficiency is therefore aiming at the
minimizing rather than eliminating these additional times as they cannot
be zero.

\hypertarget{additional-taxi-in-time}{%
\section{Additional Taxi-In Time}\label{additional-taxi-in-time}}

The additional taxi-in time measures the travel time of an arriving
flight from its touchdown (i.e.~actual landing time {[}ALDT{]}) to its
stand/gate position (i.e.~actual in-block time {[}AIBT{]}). The observed
travel time (i.e.~taxi time) is compared to a reference time. The
reference time is determined for flights arriving at the same runway
and/or the same stand/gate position. Research showed that the taxi-times
are not dependent on the type of aircraft. The additional taxi-in time
provides a pointer for the management of the inbound surface traffic.

Due to data availability constraints (i.e.~no stand/gate information),
the reference times for the Brazilian airports have been computed on the
airport level. It needs to be noted that such aggregation at the airport
level may be influenced by the predominant runway configuration and
frequently used stand/parking positions. This phenomenon merits further
study in one of the future editions.

Figure~\ref{fig-txit} shows the variation of the observed additional
taxi-in times.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-txit-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-txit}Additional taxi-in time}

\end{figure}

The observed additional taxi-in times vary across the different
airports. The majority of airports have average additional taxi-in times
at or below 2 minutes per arrival. This suggests that arrivals are
rarely subject to taxi constraints.

In Europe, Rome Fiumicino (LIRF) observed additional taxi-in times of
higher than 4 minutes per arrival in 2019. With the decreasing traffic
load during 2020 and 2021, additional taxi-in times fell sharply to 2,5
min in 2020 and 2,15 minutes per arrival. At London Heathrow (EGLL),
average additional taxi-in times improved in 2020 by about three
quarters of a minute. However, with increasing traffic load in 2021,
higher additional taxi-in times were accrued again. A similar pattern
was observed at other European airports with increasing additional
taxi-in times, e.g. Zurich (LSZH), Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG),
Madrid (LEMD), Amsterdam (EHAM), Munich (EDDM), and Frankfurt (EDDF).
This suggests that there are still local procedures in place to address
COVID or post-COVID related utilisation of stands.

Additional taxi-in times in Brazil varied across the airports. Traffic
at Rio de Janeiro's Galeão (SBGL) airport deteriorated significantly.
Despite lower traffic levels, the additional taxi-in time increased from
around 3 minutes in 2019; to just under 4 minutes per arrival in 2020,
and further increased to just under 6 minutes per arrival in 2021. Rio
de Janeiro (SBRJ) observed an increase to over 3 minutes per arrival in
2020 and 2021. Arriving traffic at Porto Alegre (SBPA) experienced lower
additional taxi-in times in 2021. Compared to 2019 and 2020, performance
improved by over a minute per arrival. On average, additional taxi-in
times decreased at the other airports across the years. Thus, showing a
positive associated with decreasing traffic.

The variations across the airports suggests that local specifics
contributed to the varying taxi-in performance.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-txitcloselook-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-txitcloselook}Monthly evolution of additional
taxi-in time at SBGL and EGLL}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-txitcloselook} compares the evolution of the additional
taxi-in time at two of the study airports. A sharp increase of the
average additional taxi-in time is observed at both Galeão (SBGL) and
London Heathrow (EGLL) by the end of 2020, despite significantly lower
daily traffic in comparison to 2019. At SBGL, the observed average
monthly additional taxi-in times increased even further in the beginning
of 2021. EGLL saw a drop following the Chrismas/New Year season and then
experienced a strong increase of the additional taxi-in times. These
patterns have to be contrasted with with the shallow increase of daily
traffic.

\hypertarget{additional-taxi-out-time}{%
\section{Additional Taxi-Out Time}\label{additional-taxi-out-time}}

The additional taxi-out time addresses the travel time of a departing
aircraft from when it can move away from its stand/gate position
(i.e.~actual off-block time {[}AOBT{]}) until the aircraft takes off
(i.e.~actual take-off time {[}ATOT{]}). This travel time is compared to
an associated reference time.

As mentioned above, the taxi-times at Brazilian airports are determined
on the airport level and the observed additional taxi-out times may be
influenced by the predominant runway system - stand combinations for
departure traffic. The inclusion of stand/gate positions is foreseen for
future iterations.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-txot-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-txot}Additional taxi-out time}

\end{figure}

San Salvador (SBSV) in Brazil and Europe's Rome Fiumicino (LIRF) and
London Heathrow (EGLL) observed high average additional taxi-out times
in 2019. For the majority of the airports, average additional taxi-out
times are at or below 4 minutes per departure. In both regions, taxi-out
performance was affected by the lower level of air traffic and typically
resulted in a reduction of the average additional taxi-out time. In
Brazil however, SBGL and SBBR showed increased additional taxi-out times
in 2020 compared to 2019. This signals a substantial change of the
taxi-operations based on the predominant usage of stands. Interestingly,
additional taxi-out times varied differently across airports when
comparing 2020 vs 2021. While in many instances the change is neglible
(smaller than 30 sec per departure), Munich (EDDM) and Amsterdam (EHAM)
showed a discernible increase in the observed additional taxi-out times.
This was related to the re-opening of closed parts of the terminal in
line with the general increase in air traffic.

In both regions, flights observed a higher additional taxi-out time than
taxi-in time. Thus, air traffic services in both regions manage
departure queues more actively by separating and sequencing traffic
within the maneuver area. This may be linked to higher interactions
between departing traffic, or departing and arriving traffic.

\hypertarget{mapping-of-taxi-out-and-taxi-in}{%
\section{Mapping of Taxi-out and
Taxi-in}\label{mapping-of-taxi-out-and-taxi-in}}

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-txit-txot-scatter-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-txit-txot-scatter}Comparison and evolution of
additional taxi-in and taxi-out times}

\end{figure}

The following analysis builds on the observations of the previous
sections. Figure Figure~\ref{fig-txit-txot-scatter} reveals different
patterns in Brazil and Europe. In general surface movement operations
see a higher variation in Brazil than in Europe. Within the European
region London Heathrow (EGLL) and Rome Fiumicino (LIRF) experienced a
strong reduction of the additional taxi-out time due to the reduced
traffic in 2020. On average the returning traffic did not impact the
additional taxi-in and taxi-out times observed in 2020 and 2021.

With the exception of Rome Fiumicino (LIRF) and London Heathrow (EGLL)
and the observed high additional taxi-out times at these airports, the
spread between additional taxi-in and taxi-out time is smaller in Europe
than in Brazil. This suggests that operational constraints are of
systemic nature and less dependent on the level of traffic. This may
reveal differences in the management of arriving and departing traffic
in both regions. All European airports of this study operate ACDM
\footnote{ACDM implementation at EGKK is on-going, c.f.
  https://www.eurocontrol.int/concept/airport-collaborative-decision-making.}
processes. ACDM aims to optimise the use of resources and improving the
predictability of air traffic, in particular departing traffic. Further
research is needed to analyse the impact of ACDM on the departure
process with the average additional taxi-out times typically 2-3 minutes
higher than the additional taxi-in times.

\hypertarget{evolution-of-additional-taxi-times-in-early-2022}{%
\section{Evolution of Additional Taxi-Times in early
2022}\label{evolution-of-additional-taxi-times-in-early-2022}}

This section highlights and compares the performance observed in the
first part of 2022, i.e. January through June. Typically, taxi-in
operations are less constrained than taxi-out operations. However,
flights taxiing in may be subject to interaction with other surface
movements when approaching the apron or need to hold until a parking
position is vacated.

\caption{\label{fig-monthly-txits-bra}Evolution of monthly average
additional taxi-in times at Brazilian study airports}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-monthly-txits-bra} shows the monthly evolution of the
average additional taxi-in times in Brazil. On average, monthly
additional taxi-in times showed a smoother behaviour in 2020, 2021, and
the first half of 2022 than in comparison to 2019. In particular, a
higher level of variation and share of additional taxi-in times were
observed in 2019 at Galeão (SBGL), São Paulo/Guarulhos (SBGR), São Paulo
(SBSP), and for the first part of the year in Salvador (SBSV). For the
beginning of 2022 arriving flights in Brazil accrued additional taxi-in
times of 2 minutes or less. This evidences that incoming flights are not
subject to higher constraints while taxiing in.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-monthly-txots-bra-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-monthly-txots-bra}Evolution of monthly average
additional taxi-out times at Brazilian study airports}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-monthly-txots-bra} shows the taxi-out performance
observed at Brazilian study airports. The monthly taxi-out performance,
on average, improved in comparison to 2019 at all airports. Brazilia is
the only airport that showed a higher level of variability in 2020
during the first month of COVID. With the exception of Rio de Janeiro
(SBRJ) and Sao Paulo (SBSP), observed additional taxi-out times follow
the pattern of 2020 and 2021. This suggests that taxi-out procedures
were adapted during COVID and taxi-out performance was stabilised on
similar levels. SBRJ showed a step increase in taxi-put time in April
2022. Additional taxi-out times before and after the step were constant.
This suggests a procedural change at the airfield. SBSP showed an
increase in accrued additional taxi-out times as of February 2022 and
reached levels of taxi-out performance simlar to pre-COVID levels
(2019).

\hypertarget{additional-time-in-terminal-airspace}{%
\section{Additional Time in Terminal
Airspace}\label{additional-time-in-terminal-airspace}}

The additional time in terminal airspace is calculated as the difference
between the actual travel time from entering the sequencing area (100NM
radius around the airport) to the landing time and an associated
reference time for the entry sector, aircraft class, and landing runway.
The reference times are established based on 2019.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-asma-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-asma}Additional time in terminal airspace}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-asma} shows the observed annual average additional time
in terminal airspace for all airports. The additional time in terminal
airspace followed different patterns in Brazil and Europe. Generally,
additional ASMA times are higher in Brazil than in Europe \footnote{The
  assessment of additional ASMA time for Brazil is based on a dataset
  that spans several months and partial years. For this study, data for
  2018 is attributed to 2019. The data set will be complemented in
  future updates of this comparison. The overall behaviour of arrival
  times is assumed to not be affected across the years.}, although,
arrival sequencing in 2019 (pre-COVID) shows some airports in Europe
with extremely high additional times, e.g. Zurich (LSZH), London
Heathrow (EGLL), and London Gatwick (EGKK).

The approach concept for London arrivals differs from other airports. To
achieve maxium runway utilization, aircraft are held close to the
airport. This resulted in higher ASMA times in 2019. The observed
additional ASMA times for EGLL and EGKK in 2021 need to be interpreted
based on the GANP algorithm chosen for this report. Reference times are
determined based on the actual travel times in 2019. Thus, the negative
annual average ASMA time for Heathrow (EGLL) and the extremely low
result for Gatwick (EGKK) in 2021 demonstrate that at both airports the
lower traffic levels in the following years are served differently.
Obviously, the 2019 reference times comprise procedural elements,
i.e.~include sequencing induced additional time, and are too high for
the observed traffic in 2021. For future studies it will be interesting
to enhance the metric to account for substantial changes of the
prevailing traffic. This also highlights that the London arrival and
procedures benefitted significantly from the lower air traffic and
yielded less holding and sequencing constraints on airspace users.
Across the other European airports the change between the pre-COVID year
2019 and the observed performance in 2020 and 2021 is clearly visible.
However, the overall change between 2020 and 2021 is - on average -
negligible. This suggests that the metric measures procedural aspects in
the arrival management at these airports offering room for improvement
as these accrued additional times are independent of the traffic.
Traffic at São Paulo Guarulhos (SBGR) observed additional times in 2019
and 2020 above four minutes per arrival. Its reduction in 2021 may be
related to the new airspace design for São Paulo TMA and correlated
airways changes, the TMA SP Neo Project implemented in May/2021. Higher
additional times are observed in 2021 at Campinas (SBKP), Curitiba
(SBCT), and Brasilia (SBBR), which also can derive from airways
modification. DECEA keeps this assessment ongoing, as the demand returns
to 2019 levels. For the majority of Brazilian airports, arrival traffic
in 2021 experienced higher additional times than in the previous years,
while the observed additional times for 2019 and 2020 ranged in the same
order of magnitude. The average additional times at Brazilian airports
ranged typically between two and four minutes per arrival. Traffic at
São Paulo Guarulhos (SBGR) observed additional times in 2019 and 2020
above four minutes per arrival.

For future reports the data for the assessment of the additional
terminal time will be complemented for Brazil. This will allow to better
investigate the changes observed across the years \footnote{The
  assessment of additional ASMA time for Brazil is based on a dataset
  that spans several months and partial years. For this study, data for
  2018 is attributed to 2019. The data set will be complemented in
  future updates of this comparison. The overall behaviour of arrival
  times is assumed to not be affected across the years.}. This edition
of the comparison suggests that there were changes to the en-route /
arrival interface across the majority of Brazilian airports.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{./06-efficiency_files/figure-pdf/fig-asma-vs-traffic-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-asma-vs-traffic}Comparison of additional time in
terminal airspace}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-asma-vs-traffic} shows the change of average additional
time in terminal airspace in both regions comparing 2019 to 2021
\footnote{The additional time in terminal airspace is calculated for
  arrival flights for which the required data was available.
  Accordingly, the number of ``valid'' flights might differ from the
  overall number of arrivals reported for the airports.}.

This comparison shows the effect of the decline of air traffic in the
European region on arriving traffic. For all airports, the lower traffic
levels resulted in a reduction of the additional time accrued by the
arrivals. However it is also noteworthy to stress that in several cases,
procedures have a prevalent role on arrival sequencing. This can be
observed for airports that show a relatively low change of the observed
additional time while the number of arrivals significantly declined.

Overall, the change in terms of observed average additional time in the
terminal airspace is characterised by a rearrangement of the airports.
The overall trend of an increase in sequencing times for arrivals was
shown already in Figure~\ref{fig-asma}. Based on the available data for
this assessment (c.f. number of valid flights), the change in
operational procedures might be masked. This will require further
investigations in future editions of this bi-regional comparison.
However, it is evident that the Brazilian system showed a lower level of
change in the management of arrival traffic when comparing 2019 and
2021, recalling that the comparison kept the unimpeded reference time
from 2019 for all years. This suggests that the observed performance is
representative of the region, i.e.~applied operational procedures, and
less dependent on the volume of air traffic.

\hypertarget{flight-time-variability}{%
\section{Flight Time Variability}\label{flight-time-variability}}

Flight time variability determines the level of predictability for
airspace users and hence has an impact on airline scheduling. It focuses
on the variance associated with the individual phases of flight as
experienced by airspace users. This provides an integrated gate-to-gate
view, as flight time is determined by the taxi-out, en-route, and
taxi-in durations. Although the measure (i.e.~flight time) may also be
impacted by weather influences, runway system orientation of departure
and arrival aerodrome, and prevailing en-route weather conditions, the
variability of the flight time comprises also synchronisation and
sequencing measures of air navigation services, including airspace
constraints.

For this report, flight time variability is calculated for the top 5
connections between the study airports. This serves as a proxy for the
regional networks. Variability is determined as the half of the spread
between the 85th and 15th percentile for flights on these connections.

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{\label{fig-flight-time-var}Monthly flight time variability
between study airports in Brazil and Europe}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-flight-time-var} shows the flight time variability for
the top 5 connections among study airports in each phase of flight in
both regions. Median flight time variability is less pronouced in Brazil
than in Europe (depicted by the blue line). On average, both regions
showed for the selected connections and flight phases different levels
of monthly variability. The observed median pattern is smoother in
Brazil than in Europe with a lower level of seasonality. In Brazil,
lower traffic levels as part of the observed COVID waves were
discernible for the surface operations only. The airborne phase - while
showing high variations for certain periods - appeared to be independent
on the traffic load in the system across the period from 2019 through
2021 for its median. A clear seasonal pattern was observed for taxi-out
phase in Europe. Furthermore, median flight time variability in each
phase reflected the overall traffic development in the region. Despite
lower traffic levels, departing traffic experienced higher variability
in the winter season 2020/2021. A similar pattern was observed for the
en-route/airborne portion of flight. The median variability of taxi-in
times were less dependent on the traffic levels, however followed the
overall reduction of air transport following the pandemic declaration by
WHO in March 2020. The change in terms of air transport in Europe was
clearly visible in the median variation of the airborne flight time
variability.There is a discernible drop by about 2 minutes for the
period March 2020 through autumn 2021.

\hypertarget{summary-4}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-4}}

Operational efficiency provides an insight in benefit pools to be
exploited. Improvements in terms of operational efficiency can be
directly linked to aircraft flying time and fuel burn. In that respect,
efficiency constraints impact the cost base of airspace user operations.
While high performant operations will still yield a certain level of
inefficiency (and associated additional times or variability), the
identification of potential areas of improvement can help to enhance
overall air navigation system performance and airspace user experience.

Surface movement performance in Brazil and Europe showed similarities
and indicated that same operational concepts and practices are applied.
On average, departing traffic in both regions observed a higher level of
additional taxi-out time than compared to the observed additional
taxi-in times across the years 2019 through 2021. Surface movement
operations showed a higher variability in Brazil than in Europe. It will
be interesting to study the respective drivers for this wider spread in
future reports.

The analysis of sequencing and the management of arriving flights showed
certain differences. Although trends might be masked and impacted by the
available data for this comparison for Brazil, the sequencing of arrival
flights appeared to be independent of the traffic volume. The increase
in additional times in 2021 appeared to be linked to a change in terms
of en-route / terminal airspace interface. For the European context, the
overall reduction in air traffic resulted in lower pressure on the
sequencing of arrivals. On average, arriving traffic at all airports
observed a lower additional times. This provides a pointer to a
potential benefit pool in Europe as the success of arrival management
(in particular arrival sequencing) varies with traffic levels. This
report also showed the stark drop of accrued additional times at London
airports, i.e. London Heathrow (EGLL) and Gatwick (EGKK). As additional
times are calculated based on the performance observed in a reference
year (in this report 2019), it is evident that these reference times
already comprise a high level of congestion. It seems to be the opposite
case for Brazil, where reduced demand did not necessarily reflect lower
additional times. This suggests that the measured level of inefficiency
- in this report - changed significantly across the period 2019 through
2021 and may be higher than reported if the reference time varies
yearly.

Overall, flight time variability showed similar extreme variations in
both regions. However, on average, the Brazilian system is less impacted
by seasonal variation and network operations showed a lower change in
light of the varying traffic situations across the years. With both
systems returning to 85-90\% of pre-COVID traffic levels, it will be
interesting to observe how each system will react to returning traffic
load.

\hypertarget{overview-and-motivation}{%
\section{Overview and Motivation}\label{overview-and-motivation}}

At ICAO Assembly 40 in 2019 two global aspirational goals for curbing
the impact of the international aviation sector were agreed. This
includes an annual fuel efficiency improvement of 2\% through 2050 and
carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards (c.f. ICAO (2019b)). Across the
globe, states have defined ambitious political goals to address the
impact of climate change. For example, the European Union launched its
Green Deal (European Commission (2019)) and Fit-for-55 initiative. The
latter strives strives towards cutting the net greenhouse gas emissions
by at least 55\% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels (European Commission
(2021)).

In general terms, air navigation shall contribute to the protection of
the environment by considering noise, gaseous emissions and other
environmental issues in the implementation and operation (KPA
Environment, c.f. Appendix D ICAO (2005). Accordingly, there is a higher
interest in monitoring/estimating the impact of operational
(in)efficiency. Operational inefficiencies typically increase the
aircraft flying time (i.e.~airborne and surface movement times) and ,
thus, engine running time. Engine time is directly linked to fuel burn
and associated emissions and pollutants. In that respect, inefficiencies
contribute to the ditremental effect of excessive emissions to climate
change.

The Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) proposes indicators for regional
benchmarking (ICAO 2019a). However, there is no detailed guidance on how
to measure \emph{additional fuel burn}. Fuel burn per se is known to the
aircraft operator. While the actual fuel burn and fuel flow during the
flight is recorded (e.g.~flight data recorder), these data are not
commonly shared. It is noteworthy that aircraft operators have to report
their fuel burn per flight in Brazil (c.f. ANAC reporting files). This
level of data is not available in Europe (or generally across the
globe).

For this report, both groups tapped into openly available data sources
and developed an initial approach to quantifying operational
inefficiencies with respect to fuel burn. It is planned to refine this
approach in consultation with the international operational performance
benchmarking community.

\hypertarget{fuel-burn-estimation}{%
\section{Fuel Burn Estimation}\label{fuel-burn-estimation}}

The appendix presents an initial approach to estimating fuel burn during
taxi operations as part of a comparison report.
Figure~\ref{fig-example-fb} depicts the monthly estimated fuel burn at a
European hub for the taxi-in and taxi-out phase. It must be noted that
the metric uses parameters of the ICAO landing and take-off cycle (LTO).
The LTO estimates represent upper bounds for the fuel estimation and
overestimates the actual fuel burn.

European hub airport}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-example-fb} highlights that there is a higher fuel burn
during the departure phase. This phase entails the take-off roll with a
thrust setting at or close to 100\%. This adds a substantial component
to the fuel burn during take-off in comparison to the taxi-in phase. As
mentioned above, the quantities shown reflect upper bounds based on the
LTO assumptions and do not account for operational reduction measures
such as single-engine taxi or reduced thrust take-offs. It is planned to
refine the approach with the international benchmarking community and
account for such operational measures.

\section{Environmental Benefit Pool -
Taxi}\label{environmental-benefit-pool---taxi}}

Earlier work has introduced the concept of an environmental benefit
pool, c.f. EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit and FAA Air Traffic
Organization (2019).

}

\caption{\label{fig-fuel-pool-taxi-in}Benefit pool in terms of
additional fuel burn during taxi-in phase}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-fuel-pool-taxi-in} shows the fuel benefit pool for the
taxi-in phase per arrival. The benefit pool is influenced by the fleet
mix and the overall taxi-in performance. Thus, it varies significantly
across the airports.

With the exception of Rome Fiumicino (LIRF), there is an increase in the
benefit pool when comparing 2020 and 2021 within the European region.

\caption{\label{fig-fuel-pool-taxi-out}Benefit pool in terms of
additional fuel burn during taxi-out}

\end{figure}

Comparing Figure~\ref{fig-fuel-pool-taxi-out} with
Figure~\ref{fig-fuel-pool-taxi-in} shows the overall impact of higher
observed taxi-out times and the high-thrust take-off run. For the major
hubs in Europe the traffic decline during the COVID phase culminated in
sharp decline of the average additional fuel burn per departure when
comparing 2019 levels to 2020 or 2021. The impact of congestions on the
taxi-operations and the associated refernce times was highlighted
already in the efficiency chapter. In light of this, the results for
London Heathrow (EGLL) and London Gatwick (EGKK) need to be interpreted
comparing the absolute different between the different years. The
decline in traffic allowed to operate without constraints which resulted
in a - numerical - gain.\\
However, this showcases that the determined reference times internalised
inefficiencies. The values for these airports range higher than
presented. Future research will address how such variations in terms of
traffic load can be better captured as part of the benefit pool
approach.

The following Figures depicts the observed shares of additional fuel
burn for taxi-out and taxi-in. It must be noted that the totals are

\section{Summary}\label{summary-5}}

This chapter is a first attempt to estimate the environmental impact of
operational inefficiencies at airports. The determined benefit pools for
taxi-in and taxi-out vary significantly between airports. While
operational inefficiencies, e.g.~higher sequencing and holding times,
impact on the overall taxi-phase duration - and ultimately - the total
fuel burnt during these phases, the metric is also dependent on the
different fleet mix observed at these airports. The impact of
wide-bodies (and primarily international traffic) can be readily
observed for the major hubs during 2019. The COVID related decline of
operations of these types and connections, resulted in a sharp drop of
the measured benefit pool in 2020 and 2021.

Based on the underlying databank of aircraft types and associated fuel
burn indices, more detailed analyses will be feasible in future reports.

\chapter{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

This second iteration of the Brazil-Europe operational ANS performance
comparison report builds on the joint project between the DECEA
Performance Section and the Performance Review Unit of EUROCONTROL.

The collaboration project aims at the development of a joint and common
understanding of agreed metrics and definitions to compare, understand,
and improve operational air navigation system performance. This report
uses a subset of the key performance indicators established by ICAO's
GANP. The work is also used as a show-case for applying the GANP
indicators within a bi-regional project, to augment the associated
guidance material, and inform further multi-regional comparison efforts.
The comparison shows similarities and differences in the observed
performance in both regions. Throughout the report several observations
and ideas for future research have been identified. This will allow to
further develop and complement the performance framework.

The first part of this report examined commonalities and differences in
terms of air traffic management organisation and performance influencing
factors, such as air traffic demand and fleet composition. These factors
can have a large influence on the observed performance. Overall, air
navigation service provision is more fragmented in Europe with
local/national ANSPs and their respective control units. The integrated
civil/military service provision is inherent to the organisation of
DECEA and the Brazilian system. Irrespective of the airspace volume, the
large difference in numbers of control units in Europe and Brazil
demonstrates this. Both systems operate a central flow management center
to ensure network wide flow management processes and functions.

Both regions encountered an unprecedented decline of air traffic in
response to COVID-19. Regional and global traffic restrictions resulted
however in different patterns regarding the initial and continued
recovery. European traffic levels showed several waves in light of the
variety of national and pan-European measures. The Brazilian evolution
of traffic showed a delayed wave pattern in comparison with Europe,
however, showed a more steady recovery overall.\\
Additional diversity in terms of air traffic was observed across the
Brazilian airports as there was a significant share of light types
serviced. Within the European context, the share of light types was
mostly negligible. A higher share of wide-body (heavy) aircraft operated
from the European airports including a higher level of international
connectivity. This is more nuanced in Brazil where the level of
international connections is more centralised.

In terms of predictability and puncutality, the results were strongly
influenced by the prevailing COVID-19 traffic evolution. Both systems
suffered from the disruption of schedules and cancellations of flight
connections. Europe showed a higher number of aircraft arriving more
than 15 minutes ahead of schedule (early arrivals) and flights departing
later than 15 minutes after their scheduled time). In Brazil, this
behaviour was only observed for arriving traffic. Returning traffic
levels drove a gradual move towards punctuality levels comparable to
2019 levels. However, there is a higher level of uncertainty in terms of
movements in both regions.

Runway system capacities in Brazil were adapted over the past years to
accommodate the projected growth. Respective capacities at European
airports were constant over the horizon of this report as part of the
local/national declaration process and operated traffic levels. Despite
the COVID-related change in traffic, accomplished peak throughput levels
ranged at the level of earlier years. This suggests that airport runway
system capacities are commensurate with the observed (and expected)
traffic levels and represent not a primary driver for operational
inefficiencies during the arrival phase.

Operational efficiency in this report is measured for the taxi-in and
taxi-out phase, and additional time in terminal airspace. Similar
patterns were observed at the different airports in both regions. On
average, arriving traffic was observing little additional taxi-in times
in both regions. However, the variation across airports suggests that
local specifics (traffic levels, used combinations of runway system /
parking positions) contributed the varying taxi-in performance. It will
be interesting to study the associated drivers in the future. The levels
of additional taxi-out times is generally higher for departing flights
in comparison to arrivals. The additional taxi-out times for the study
airports showed a clear association with the traffic levels during and
post COVID-19 in Brazil. This behaviour is less prominent for the
European airports and may be linked to the partail use of runway system,
terminals, and parking positions. In general surface movement operations
see a higher variation in Brazil than in Europe. Although trends might
be masked and impacted by the available data for this comparison for
Brazil, the sequencing of arrival flights appeared to be independent of
the traffic volume. The increase in additional times in 2021 appeared to
be linked to a change in terms of en-route / terminal airspace
interface. For the European context, the overall reduction in air
traffic resulted in lower pressure on the sequencing of arrivals. On
average, arriving traffic at all airports observed a lower additional
times. Flight time variability was obviously affected by the varying
traffic levels. However, the Brazilian system is less impacted by
seasonal variation than the European system.

Political priorities require to address the impact of air transportation
on climate change. There is a growing interest in both regions to better
quantify the potential benefit pool actionable by air navigation. This
report develped a first approach to better quantify inefficiencies
observed in the taxi-in and taxi-out phase. Higher operational
performance will ultimately lead to higher levels of fuel efficiency and
lower fuel burn. Absolute numbers in terms of fuel burn /
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions are linked to the volume of air traffic
and aircraft types in service. The latter impacts a direct comparison
and require more research for future editions. This comparison shows the
potential benefit pool at the different airports. This pool provides a
higher margin of improvement at airports with higher levels of air
traffic and large (heavy) aircraft. As such, the role of the airport
within the system - heavy aircraft \& international connectivity - is a
fundamental aspect in terms of addressing the contribution of air
navigation.

This second edition of the operational comparison between Brazil and
Europe allowed to further harmonise the application of GANP performance
measures and identified areas for further research and joint
developments. Both groups, Performance Section of DECEA and Performance
Review Unit of EUROCONTROL, plan to continue the close collaboration and
expand on the analyses of this report. This report will be updated
throughout the coming years under the umbrella of the DECEA-EUROCONTROL
memorandum of cooperation. Building on this collaboration, the idea is
to establish a web-based rolling monitoring complementing this and
future editions. A web-based monitoring will enable updates on a regular
basis. Future editions will also enable to complement data time series
and support the development of further use-case analyses. The lessons
learnt of this joint project will also be coordinated with the
multi-national PBWG and ICAO GANP Study sub-group concerned with the
further development of the GANP KPIs.

\section{Fuel Flow Estimation - Look-Up Table
Approach}\label{fuel-flow-estimation---look-up-table-approach}}

At the time of writing no consolidated fuel burn methodology for
operational performance benchmarking existed. The guidance material for
the application of the GANP KPI16 suggests to apply \textbf{average fuel
burn estimates}. To advance the state-of-the-art, PS and PRU established
a look-up table on the basis of openly available mappings of aircraft
type and (representative) engine.

With the ICAO Aircraft Engine Emissions Databank certification data for
registered engines allowed for the identification of associated fuel
flow indices for specific thrust levels per engine during the landing
and take-off cycle (LTO). Further engine specific consumption data -
primarily piston engines - were obtained from the database of the
Federal Office for Civil Aviation of Switzerland. This dataset will be
made available and further augmented with the help of the international
benchmarking community. While the approach supported a good coverage of
current aircraft types (about 90\%), there was a need to make fuel burn
assumptions for the remaining fleet.

Earlier work, c.f. EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit and FAA Air
Traffic Organization (2019), defined a benefit pool on the basis of a
generic \textbf{``average flight''} (i.e.~A320, 450NM leg). These values
were taken as defaults for aircraft types not yet accounted for in the
established data set.

For the estimation of the fuel burn in the en-route portion
(climb-cruise-descent := CCD) it is proposed to apply an heuristic
approach in future reports. This however requires for research and
validation. The principles are laid out as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ICAO's Carbon Emission Calculator Methodology supports the
  identification of \textbf{average fuel burn} on a per aerodrome pair.
\item
  The calculator methodology estimates the fuel burn on the basis of
  pre-dominantly flown aircraft types, i.e.~it can be assumed to be a
  fleet mix representative sample estimate.
\item
  This estimate can be scaled for each arrival and compared to the
  additional time in terminal airspace.
\end{itemize}

An improvement to these estimates, i.e.~estimating the fuel burn during
surface operations and during the arrival phase, will be subject to
further research.

\end{longtable}

Taxi-in is defined as the difference between the actual landing time
(ALDT) and the actual in-block time (AIBT),
i.e.~\(\small TXIT = AIBT - ALDT\).

Conversely, taxi-out is defined as \(\small TXOT = ATOT - AOBT\).

Based on the LTO assumptions, TXIT comprises phases 2 and 3. For TXOT,
phases 4 and 5 apply until the actual take-off/lift-off - strictly
speaking without the initial climb to `throttle back'.

By convention, the standard ICAO LTO cycle assumes a specific
\emph{``time-in-mode'' (TIM)} for each phase. Research has shown that
the TIMs are not representative for many airports and operations. This
report, thus, replaces the TIMs with the observed ground movement times,
i.e. ALDT, AIBT, AOBT, ATOT.

The standard LTO cycle uses 0.7 min (42 sec) for the take-off roll and
lift-off. From an operational perspective, this value is realistic for
large (and heavy) aircraft or reduced thrust take-off (resulting in
lower acceleration and longer take-off roll).\\
No provisions are made for decelaration during the landing roll
(e.g.~reverse thrust).

Per definition, the taxi-in and taxi-out indicator includes the landing
roll or take-off roll. This report applies the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  taxi-in:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    inefficiencies during the taxi-in phase are primarily encountered
    following the landing roll;
  \item
    the landing roll is a systemic duration and can be broadly assumed
    to be constant per aircraft type, variations in terms of landing
    roll (shorter \& longer durations) are equally distributed; and
  \item
    measured additional taxi-in times are therefore encountered after
    vacating the runway and during taxi to the stand/gate.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  taxi-out:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    inefficiencies during the taxiout phase are primarily encountered
    during taxi from the stand/gate to the holding point at the runway;
  \item
    line-up and take-off roll are a systemic duration and do not vary
    significantly per aircraft type, thus, can be considered equally
    distributed; and
  \item
    measured additional taxi-in times represent therefore the
    inefficiency during taxi-out.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

While the additional time approach and assumptions eliminate the need to
consider the landing-roll or take-off roll for the calculation of the
additional fuel burn during these modes, the absolute fuel burn needs to
considers the associated time-in-mode.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For the landing, ICAO LTO assumes a 7\% idle thrust and taxi
  setting.\\
  Thus, the overall measured taxi-in time,
  i.e.~\(\small TXIT = AIBT - ALDT\) is performed under the continuous
  7\% thrust setting.
\item
  For take-off operations, the take-off roll / lift-off is performed
  under 100\% thrust setting.\\
  Accordingly, the take-off roll duration needs to be deducted from the
  total observed taxi-out time.\\
  Total taxi-out fuel is then calculated based on the reduced taxi-out
  phase at 7\% thrust setting and the take-off roll at 100\% thrust
  setting.
\end{itemize}

To account for missing data regarding aircraft types and/or respective
reference engines, an estimate for the fuel burn for ``similar'' flights
is calculated on the basis of complete data records. This similarity is
based on aircraft wake turbulence category and engine type (e.g.~light
jet, medium jet, heavy/medium/light turboprop). This ensures that
nuances of the fleet mix are captured and reduces the further
overestimation by using general averages, etc.
